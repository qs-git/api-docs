# Registering for our API

Clothes2order API access is available to approved users only. Please note that we do not
charge any on-going additional fees to place orders via our API, however all applicants to
use the API must meet the following basic requirements:

- Have an existing platform in place to accept orders
- Be able to send orders electronically to us in XML or JSON format
- Have a physical contact address and some kind of customer service (minimum by email)
- Have the technical expertise (or access to the technical expertise) required to integrate an API with your own platform

If you fulfil these criteria and would like to work with Clothes2order, we would be delighted to hear from you.
Please [click here and fill in our API application form](https://www.clothes2order.com/api_login.php) and
we will assess your application as soon as possible.

Once approved, you will receive email confirmation and you will be able to log into your [API Account](https://www.clothes2order.com/docs/your-api-account) online.
You will also receive email confirmation if your application to use our API is rejected.
