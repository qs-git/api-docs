### Submit Headers

The key header to note here is the ‘Accept’ header; this allows you to use the API with either XML or JSON.

| Parameter | Options | Default   | Description |
| :---      | ------- |-----------|-------------|
| Accept    | application/xml or application/json | application/xml | Determines whether XML or JSON should be used.|
| Test-Mode | true or false                       | false | Once you have been set live on the API, you can use this header to force a test transaction. |


### Response Headers
Instead of having to check the OK/ERROR status in the content of the response, the HTTP
header code can also be checked to determine if a request was successful or not.

| HTTP Response Code | Description |
| :---               | ---         |
| 200                | Request was received successfully. |
| 400                | There was an error with your request. In the case of order submission, your order hasn’t been accepted. |
