# API Overview

Do you sell or bulk purchase customised clothing and require a company to do the fulfilment?
With the Clothes2order ordering API, you can set up your own website or other ordering medium
and send orders directly to us electronically in real time. Weâ€™ll then dispatch the completed
order straight to you or your customer.

so you can sure of receiving the best possible end result when ordering with us. To find out
